# aiKdocs

The aiKdocs project aims to train all docs from CNCF projects with ChatGPT and produces an intellegent knowledge base.

All are starting from a scratch. We welcome all contributors from anywhere.

The process of the initial roadmap is:

- Collect all doc URls of CNCF projects
- Build a model to train those docs
- Provide a web portal to be easily used by anyone

## Community, discussion, contribution, and support

Any PRs and issues are welcome on GitHub. You can reach the maintainers of this project at:
